# CatLover
My First Personal iOS App!


# Introduction
Welcome to my first passion app, ‚ÄúCatLover,‚Äù an app for people who love cats. I chose to make a cat app because I am a huge cat fan. I personally own a cat myself üê±. His name is Mocha. I build this app solely based on the CAT API  by ‚ÄúAden Forshaw.‚Äù 

Have you ever wonder what are the different type of cats, cat breeds, & their differences? You can look these answers up on the web browser, but sometimes you just want something quick and simple like a mobile app.

# Features
So far this app displays different cat breeds alphabetically. When the user clicks on a cat breed,  It would bring to a new screen that displays information and an image about the cat such as its temperament, levels of affection, vocalization, energy, and health. This app is good for people who wants to get a get a cat as pet but do not know what kind of cat breed they should be looking into. 

In addition, the user can also vote for cat pics and stored them.


# Future Version
Eventually I want to get the app published to the App Store. Here are the features I want to implement in the future 
- User login 
- Community 
- Favorite
- Random cat images
- Gifs 
- adoption 

# Problems
One of the biggest challenges I encountered while making the app is making multiple network requests to get the data I want. I used one endpoint to get a list of cat breeds sorted alphabetically. However, that endpoint doesn‚Äôt contain any images. To solve the problem, I plug the cat id I got from the first request as a parameter for another endpoint to get images for each cat breed.
